# Data Visualization Final Course Project (SMM635)

This repository contains my submission for the final course project of the SMM635 Data Visualization course at Bayes Business School, City, University of London.

## Project Overview

For this project, I independently explored a dataset, formulated research questions, and carried out a full data analysis workflow. The main objectives include:

- Selecting and preparing a suitable dataset.
- Performing in-depth data exploration and analysis.
- Creating effective and advanced visualizations to communicate key findings.
- Interpreting and presenting results as a clear and compelling data story.
- Submitting all work in a reproducible and well-documented notebook.

## Submission Requirements

- Submit a single, well-structured notebook (Jupyter, RMarkdown, or Quarto) containing your code, analysis, and commentary.
- Demonstrate best practices in data visualization, coding, and communication.
- Ensure that your report is reproducible and easy to follow.

# Data Visualization Midterm Project (SMM635)

This repository contains my solution to the midterm project for the SMM635 Data Visualization course at Bayes Business School, City, University of London.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore a provided dataset and present data-driven insights through effective visualizations and clear storytelling.

**Main tasks:**
- Select and analyze relevant variables from the dataset.
- Use appropriate data visualization techniques to highlight trends, distributions, and relationships.
- Interpret and explain your findings, discussing both insights and potential limitations.
- Present your work in a readable, well-structured, and reproducible notebook (Jupyter Notebook, RMarkdown, or Quarto).

## Submission Requirements

- Submit your code and explanations together in a single notebook file.
- Ensure your report tells a coherent, data-driven story supported by your visualizations.
- Follow best practices in coding, documentation, and visualization design.

Storytelling:
Present your findings as a clear and engaging data-driven narrative, supporting your analysis with effective visuals.

Report & Presentation:
Submit your work as an organized Jupyter Notebook (or RMarkdown/Quarto), containing both the code and the explanation of your approach, results, and interpretations.

Key requirements:

Select relevant variables and design visualizations that best illustrate trends, distributions, and relationships in the data.

Interpret the visualizations, highlighting key findings and potential limitations.
